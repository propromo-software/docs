Creating a monitor is easy.  

1. Create a new github pat token.
2. Copy the project url.
3. Visit [create-monitor](https://propromo.duckdns.org/create-monitor).

## 1. Create a new github pat token

If you want to create a monitor and the project you want to display is private,  
you need a Github pat token with read scopes first.  

You can create such token at [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).  
These are the needed scopes you need to select (*read-only* needed, no write access):  
<PhotoSwipe imageFolder="create-monitor" />

> Note: If the project is public, you just need the url of the project.  

## 2. Copy the project url

Go to the project dashboard, you want to display, and copy it's url.  
The url has the following format:  
[https://github.com/-*users or orgs*\-/\-*login-name*\-/projects/\-*id*\-/views/\-*id*\-](https://github.com/orgs/propromo-software/projects/1/views/6)

> The view part does not matter, propromo can only fetch the milestones and issues, not the views.  
> (version `2022-11-28` (latest) of the github-rest-api does not support that).
