description: Joining a Dashboard
---

If you want to join a dashboard, you need it's `project_id` first.  
The id is either in form of a link or a long string.

## `project_id`

Paste it in the input field at [propromo.duckdns.org](https://propromo.duckdns.org) and hit enter, or press the join button.  
Alternatively you could join the project at [propromo.duckdns.org/monitors](https://propromo.duckdns.org/monitors?join&id=<your_id>) if you are already logged in.

## Link

Just open the link in your webbrowser of choice.
