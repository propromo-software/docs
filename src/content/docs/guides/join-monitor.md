If you want to join a monitor, you need it's `monitor_id` first.  
The id is either in form of a link or a long string.

**Examples:**

- ID: $2y$12$C361MNrxzQnwT9GfeFNpo.UiFA/.es39JNmvSuOivSY9zqH9Jk2Fq
- URL: [propromo.duckdns.org/monitors?join&id=$2y$12$C3...](https://propromo.duckdns.org/monitors?join&id=?)

## `monitor_id`

Paste it in the input field at [propromo.duckdns.org](https://propromo.duckdns.org) and hit enter, or press the join button.  
Alternatively you could join the project at [propromo.duckdns.org/monitors?join&id=<_id_>](https://propromo.duckdns.org/monitors?join&id=?) if you are already logged in.

## Link

Just open the link in your web-browser of choice.
